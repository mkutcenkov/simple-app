# Skill: Design

This skill defines the process for creating a design proposal for a new feature.

## 1. Objective

To produce a clear, comprehensive, and well-documented design that addresses the user's requirements and can be used as a blueprint for implementation.

## 2. Process

### 2.1. Understand the Requirements
- Review the user's request and any related conversations.
- Identify the core problem to be solved.
- List the key features and acceptance criteria.

### 2.2. Create a Design Document
- Generate a new file named `DESIGN-[feature-name].md`.
- The document should contain the following sections:
    - **Overview:** A brief summary of the feature and the proposed solution.
    - **Architecture:** Describe the high-level structure, new components, and their interactions. Use diagrams if helpful.
    - **Data Model:** Detail any new data structures or database schema changes.
    - **UI/UX (if applicable):** Provide wireframes, mockups, or a textual description of the user interface and experience.
    - **Implementation Plan:** Break down the implementation into a series of small, manageable steps.
    - **Testing Strategy:** Outline the plan for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

### 2.3. Propose the Design
- Present the design document to the user for review and approval.
- Be prepared to answer questions and make revisions based on feedback.
